# Paws-itive-Vibes

Description
This application is to showcase a donations website for pets. The idea is for pet owners that have old toys or items they do not need to basically donate to those who are looking for items for their pets. We have a responsive home page showcasing pet of the month, a donatate now button which will redirect the user to the donate page. The user can either log in to store their information, or donate one time and not make an account.

## Technologies Used

This website was created using handlebars, tailwind, npm packages, mysql, and deployed using Heroku.

## Usage For Project

One of the key tools we employed for this project was Tailwind, a revolutionary CSS framework that revolutionized the way we handled the styling and layout of our code. By leveraging Tailwind, we were able to streamline our CSS workflow and achieve a consistent and visually appealing design.

In addition to Tailwind, we utilized various other technologies to bring our vision to life. We integrated MySQL, a robust relational database management system, to handle the storage and retrieval of data in the backend. This allowed us to efficiently manage our data and ensure seamless interaction between our application and the database.

To enhance our development process, we leveraged npm packages, which provided us with a vast collection of pre-built code modules and utilities. These packages accelerated our development speed, enabling us to focus more on the core functionalities of our project.

To automate the server restart process during development, we incorporated Nodemon. This handy tool monitored our server for any changes in the code and automatically restarted it, saving us precious time and effort.

To create dynamic and interactive user interfaces, we adopted Handlebars, a powerful templating engine. Handlebars allowed us to efficiently render dynamic content, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.

The initial step in our project journey involved meticulous planning and visualization. We began by wireframing our website, mapping out its structure, and sketching the desired layout. Concurrently, we meticulously designed the backend database, identifying primary and foreign keys to establish robust relationships between the various entities.

We then deployed our app to heroku to see how it looks live. From there, we coded the backend and made sure the api routes were correctly being pathed. From there, we implemented and worked on the frontend of the website.
